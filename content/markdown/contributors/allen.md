Before spoken-word poetry, hip hop and rap emerged as dominant forces in Toronto’s cultural sphere, Lillian Allen was presenting her delicately fierce, rhythmic and roaring poetics. Bending boundaries, mixing and melding genres, A two time Juno award winner, Allen's flowing messages of personal and political transformation are as relevant as when she started out some decades ago.

Community engaged, Lillian Allen is also an arts activist and a cultural strategist and has initiated and developed several key equity impacting programs. Termed a ‘cultural de-programmer’ in the arts,  she is the recipient of The Toronto Cultural Champions Award, The Margo Bindhardt Award for significantly impacting the arts in Toronto through both creative work and activism, the William P. Hubbard Award for Race Relations, most recently an honourary Doctors of Letters from Wilfred Laurier University among many other awards and citations.

Allen is currently a Creative Writing Professor at the Ontario College of Art and Design University
