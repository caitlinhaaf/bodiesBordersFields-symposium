Before spoken-word poetry, hip hop and rap emerged as dominant forces in Torontoâ€™s cultural sphere, Lillian Allen was presenting her delicately fierce, rhythmic and roaring poetics. Bending boundaries, mixing and melding genres, A two time Juno award winner, Allen's flowing messages of personal and political transformation are as relevant as when she started out some decades ago.

Allen is currently a Creative Writing Professor at the Ontario College of Art and Design University
