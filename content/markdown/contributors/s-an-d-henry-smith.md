Imani Elizabeth Jackson is a poet from Chicago working between text, performance, and food with attention to embodied ecologies, grief, and middle passage’s unfurlings. S*an D. Henry-Smith is an artist, writer, and cook working primarily in poetry, photography and performance, engaging Black experimentalisms and collaborative practices. As mouthfeel, the duo explore the entanglements of poetry, performance, ephemeral practices, and Black culinary traditions.
