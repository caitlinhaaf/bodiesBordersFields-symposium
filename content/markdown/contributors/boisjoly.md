Raymond Boisjoly is an Indigenous artist of Haida and Québécois descent based in Vancouver. Boisjoly’s practice operates as active speculation, engaging issues of Indigeneity, language as cultural practice, and the experiential aspects of materiality. His process is situated in proximity to photography, and concerns the nature of technology and its transmission as a means of indexing and understanding cultural transformation.
