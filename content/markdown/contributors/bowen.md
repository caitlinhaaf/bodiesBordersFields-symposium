Deanna Bowen is a descendant of two Alabama and Kentucky born Black Prairie pioneer families from Amber Valley and Campsie, Alberta. Bowen’s family history has been the central pivot of her auto-ethnographic interdisciplinary works since the early 1990s. She makes use of a repertoire of artistic gestures in order to map her family’s migration, define the Black body, and trace its presence and movement in place and time. In recent years, her work has involved rigorous examination of her family lineage and their connections to Vancouver’s Hogan’s Alley and Black Strathcona, the All-Black towns of Oklahoma, the extended Kentucky/Kansas Exoduster migrations and the Ku Klux Klan.
