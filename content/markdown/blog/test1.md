A "simultaneous conversation" took place on August 16, 1967 between seven speakers in Toronto and New York with the cooperation of Bell Telephone Company, the CBC and artscanada magazine (formerly Canadian Art). This cross-border conversation was recorded and published in that year's October issue of artscanada which was dedicated to 'black' as a concept, painterly medium, symbol as well as socio-political category, expression and status.
