          In this workshop, we will ask: Are we foolish enough? If foolishness
          is a signal of hope, why does it look and feel like failure? Are we
          doing enough to weaponize our desire? Could the weaponization of
          political desire be called black utopia? We will also ask: What does
          it mean to come after? How can we create space to imagine what is to
          come?

          How, through movement, can we actualize our fundamental desire for
          harmony?   How might a practice of placing our mind in its body
          constitute an act of love?   How might framing our embodied
          experiences of rhythm and shape as medicinal be a source of true
          power?   Can we use the intelligence of our arms, fingers, breath and
          voices to charge and sculpt the spaces before and between us?
