This cross-border conversation was recorded and published in that year’s October issue of artscanada, which was, dedicated to “black” as a concept, painterly medium, symbol as well as socio-political category, expression and status.</p>\n<p>Convened by Denise Ryner in collaboration with Yaniya Lee, Bodies Borders Fields is a free, public symposium that re-imagines the 1967 conversation about “blackness” with particular attention to blackness and fugitivity as represented in critical art practices today. Responding to an absence of black experience in the conversation between the 1967 panelists—an absence that has since been examined by writers Fred Moten, Krys Verrall and others—Bodies Borders Fields will dislocate the original panel discussion to contemporary contexts and representations of black and blackness in sound, performance and visual culture with respect to black social life and expression.</p>\n<p>Bodies Borders Fields supports ongoing and future discussions of blackness as an ever-shifting, circulating and transforming factor for the survival and destabilization of colonial systems and institutions. All are welcome, especially those who recognize their own stake in contemporary readings of black and blackness as both signifier and lived-experience.</p>\n<p>All roundtables, talks and panels are free and open to the public. </p>\n<p><strong>Register for the symposium</strong> <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/bodies-borders-fields-symposium-tickets-77522691457?utm-medium=discovery&#x26;utm-campaign=social&#x26;utm-content=attendeeshare&#x26;aff=escb&#x26;utm-source=cp&#x26;utm-term=listing\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </p>\n<p>Additional, individual registration is required for the following events as capacity is limited.</p>\n<p><strong>WORKSHOP: Writing with Jessica Lynne</strong>\nSaturday November 23 | 11:00AM <br>\nRegister <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/78127921717\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>WORKSHOP: Aesthetics of Black Performance and Sound with Steffani Jemison</strong>\nSaturday November 23 | 3:00PM\nRegister <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/78127969861\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Performance Brunch: sun/sea with Sean D.
